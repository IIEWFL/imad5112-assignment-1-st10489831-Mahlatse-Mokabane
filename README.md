THE PURPOSE:

Planning meals can be very stressful, especially for the people with busy schedules, which is why this app is convenient. The purpose of the Meal Recommendation App is to guide users in deciding meals according to the time of day. The app allows users to enter the current time and get meal recommendations based on particular times of the day the user inputs. The app makes it easier for the user by saving time in deciding on what to cook and reduces the stress of meal planning, it is also helpful in terms of the user discovering new meals to try out.

THE DESIGN OF THE APP:

The user interface is designed in a way that is creative and is simple to use, the user interface is designed in LinearLayout which makes the homescreen clear, neat and arranges the TextView, EditText and Buttons in a straight and centered format. There are 3 buttons which are the Recommend, Reset and Dismiss buttons. The recommend button will show a meal, the Reset button will clear the output and the text and the Dismiss button will exit the application. The app also includes a TOAST which is simply a pop-up text to show that you have successfully reset the output and the text. 

HOW THE APP WORKS:

The app works very easily all you need to do is:

*You have to input the current time of the day 

*Press the recommend button 

*The app will then automatically recommend a meal for that specific time of day the user has entered

*Then you click the reset button which will clear both the input and your display, and a toast message will pop up.

*Then you will dismiss the app once you have got the recommendation for the meal of the given time of day.

UTILIZATION OF GITHUB AND GITHUB ACTIONS:

To upload your Android Studio program to GitHub, you need to:

*close your project on andriod studio, then right click the program you wish to move to Github and select open Git Bash here.

*Then you will make use of the Git commands:
* git init : This will initialize a new Git repository in your current directory.
* git add . : This will stage all files in the directory for them to be commited.
* git commit -m "Assignment 1" : This will save a snapshot of the changes in the local repository, the m flag allows you to add a commit message.
* git  remote add origin https://github.com/IIEWFL/imad5112-assignment-1-st10489831-Mahlatse-Mokabane.git : This will link your repository, then you replace your <repository_link> with your URL of your repository.
* git push origin main :This will attempt to upload local commits from the main branch to the remote repository.
* git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories : This pulls changes from the remote main branch.
* git push origin main : This pushes the local branch to the remote repository.
